This is indeed a very exciting and rapidly evolving area within drug discovery. Let me elaborate on what it entails and why it's so impactful.\n\nEssentially, this development focuses on using Artificial Intelligence to **design and refine potential drug molecules** from scratch or to optimize existing ones. Traditionally, drug discovery involved a lot of trial-and-error, synthesizing and testing vast numbers of compounds to find ones that interacted with a specific biological target. AI is dramatically accelerating and improving this process.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key aspects:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **What it is:** This is perhaps the most revolutionary aspect. Generative AI models are trained on enormous datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying \"language\" of chemistry – what makes a molecule stable, how atoms connect, and what gives a molecule a specific function.\n*   **How it works:** Once trained, these models can be prompted to generate *entirely new* molecular structures that have never been synthesized before. You can guide the AI by specifying desired properties, such as:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly it should bind to a particular protein target.\n    *   **Solubility:** How well it dissolves in water or other bodily fluids.\n    *   **Lipophilicity:** Its tendency to dissolve in fats/oils, affecting how it's absorbed.\n    *   **Toxicity:** Minimizing unwanted side effects or interactions.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** Ensuring the molecule can actually be manufactured in a lab.\n*   **Examples of AI Models:** Technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are commonly used here, along with transformer-based architectures that have proven successful in natural language processing.\n\n**2. Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Properties:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Even before designing entirely new molecules, AI can be used to predict how well a *given* molecule (either existing or newly designed) will perform.\n*   **How it works:** AI models are trained to predict various properties of molecules based on their structure. This includes:\n    *   **Drug-Target Interaction:** Predicting how well a molecule will fit into and interact with a specific disease-causing protein.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetics (PK):** How the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug.\n    *   **Pharmacodynamics (PD):** The drug's biochemical and physiological effects.\n    *   **Off-target effects:** Predicting if the molecule might interact with unintended targets, leading to side effects.\n*   **Benefit:** This allows researchers to filter out unpromising candidates early, saving significant time and resources that would otherwise be spent on laboratory synthesis and testing.\n\n**3. In Silico Screening (Virtual Screening) Enhancement:**\n\n*   **What it is:** This is the process of searching through massive digital libraries of existing or predicted molecules to find those that are most likely to interact with a specific disease target.\n*   **How AI improves it:**\n    *   **Speed and Scale:** AI can screen billions of compounds orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.\n    *   **Accuracy:** AI models can learn more complex patterns of interaction than simpler computational models, leading to more accurate predictions.\n    *   **Novelty:** By combining generative AI with screening, researchers can not only find existing molecules but also design novel ones tailored to the target.\n\n**Why is this a \"New Development\"?**\n\nWhile computational chemistry and virtual screening have existed for decades, the **scale, sophistication, and generative capabilities** of modern AI are what make this a significant leap forward.\n\n*   **From \"Finding\" to \"Creating\":** Previous methods were largely about finding existing molecules that *might* work. Generative AI is about *creating* molecules specifically designed to work.\n*   **Data-Driven Insights:** AI can identify subtle relationships and patterns in vast chemical and biological data that are invisible to human researchers.\n*   **Reduced Cost and Time:** The ability to design and predict properties virtually dramatically reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments, potentially bringing new drugs to market faster and cheaper.\n\n**In essence, AI in molecule design is transforming drug discovery from a largely empirical process into a more rational, predictive, and creative one.** It's about designing molecules with specific \"instructions\" rather than just hoping to stumble upon the right one.\n\nAre there any aspects of this you'd like me to dive deeper into, perhaps the specific types of AI models or the challenges involved?\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven molecule design and optimization is quite diverse and rapidly evolving.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
